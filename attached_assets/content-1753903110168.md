Welcome Home Landscaping & PowerWashing30 Mar

I invested many years into building my landscaping business in Louisiana, driven by the desire to support my family. The work was deeply rewarding, yet I often felt a longing for something more—a chance to create not just a business but a lasting legacy. It was at this crossroads that Texas beckoned to me.

After months of researching and exploring various towns, I discovered Aubrey, Texas. The moment I arrived, I sensed that it was where I was meant to be. The warmth of the growing community, the opportunities presented by a strong economy, and the family-friendly atmosphere all came together, reaffirming my choice—this felt like home.

Starting anew in a different state posed its challenges, but I approached it with experience, dedication, and a heartfelt passion for designing beautiful outdoor spaces. Gradually, my business began to flourish. As word spread, I found joy in helping families and businesses transform their properties, just as I had transformed my path.

Aubrey has offered my family more than just stability; it has provided us with excellent schools and a caring community. This journey has evolved beyond mere business; it has become a meaningful endeavor to create something that will truly last for generations. Looking back, I realize that moving to Texas was not only pivotal for my career but also truly impactful for my family’s future, bringing us closer together in a place where we can all thrive.

New scam alert. Not sure if this has made its way to anyone. But thought I would share. Amazon will not text you for recalls. DO NOT click any links if you receive this type of message. You can easily validate the order number in your account without clicking the link. You will find it’s not a valid order number. If there was a recall it would list the specific item and instructions, etc. Amazon would also communicate this via email. Please be diligent and notify your friends and family who may not be aware of these types of scams. (Elder parents aunts, uncles, neighbors etc.)\\

Mina is the absolute best! He’s talented, efficient and reasonably priced. He’s always so nice as well. Over the last 4.5 years he has repaired for us the following: 2 refrigerators, a freezer(twice), a garbage disposal, dishwasher and dryer lint issue. We like him very much and always feel as though we are treated fairly!\\

Anyone recently replaced their Sprinkler valve (guy said it is the main valve) Please let me know how much it cost? I find that $350 is a high cost, correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks I went ahead and replaced it for the given price...some people agreed that it was reasonable. I'm out of town for the next few days and just wanted to be done with it. Thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts on this.\\

Tender Smokehouse\\

We had the most delicious BBQ in Aubrey today. Tender Smokehouse was clean, fast to serve, and excellent customer service. The wait staff and General Manager stopped by to see how we were doing, taking care to answer questions or fill requests.I am not one to leave a restaurant and comment that the food was excellent, but it was. We had the family plate which allowed us to try almost every meat they smoke and side they make- Baked beans, potato salad, Mac and cheese and a coleslaw with pineapple Afterwards we tried the banana pudding… it was like a mousse and so creamy. There are three locations and 2 major baseball players have invested in it. We will go back for sure!\\

Shihan We’ve tried Fresh Thai off of 380. It’s ok but not great. Very inconsistent with spice level requests. I would rate it a 5 out 10 overall. I’ve lived in Bangkok, Thailand so am kind of a food snob when it comes to Thai & Vietnamese cuisine.\\
