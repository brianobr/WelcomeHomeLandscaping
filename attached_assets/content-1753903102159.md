Very happy with Derrick. He shows up when he says he will. He notices things that need addressing then gives us a quote for doing it. We had him do major spring clean-up including leaf removal and killing and hauling off out of control weeds in multiple beds. He started a weed & feed program for our lawn and does an exceptional job when he mows including weed wacking and blowing. Great attention to detail, friendly, responsive to emails. He charges more than our previous service but happy to say, we are getting our money's worth. We can see an improvement everywhere we look.

Hello, Derrick, Good morning, it has been two weeks since you promised to come back to finish placing the missing pieces of at lease 25 pieces of St. Augustine sod you counted short for sod installed in back yard. So far the 25 pieces you promised have not been installed yet. Could you please let me know when you are going to install the 25 pieces of sod that you have promised for the back yard? Thank you very much for your help, Joanna

Easy to work with, and job was done within 2 days of requesting service. Cleaned yard of leaves and took away the bags, and mulched. Very pleased with the service.

If I were you I would avoid this business like a plague. The people kept making up stories and lies about their work and failed to show up for 5 consecutive times. They would take your deposit money first and then not show up. Not only would they waste your time by you trying to locate and communicate with them. You would have to push them to do the service that they got paid to do as they would have no communication after they took your deposit. They promised to show up for one week now, quote first thing in the morning for 5 times now, and two others coming in the afternoons. Do not trust a word from them. The business owner also has no reliability, accountability, nor sense of care. If you need to meet a timeline, take care of your home, or avoid hassles, you are asking for troubles by hiring Welcome Home Landscaping and Powerwashing. From the bottom of my heart please do not do it. I thought my experience was antidotal, but my neighbors were also telling me the same things as they contacted the business when the service people passed along their business cards. My dear friends, do not waste your time and effort, I would not want this to happen to you.
